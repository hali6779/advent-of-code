# Advent of Code

## Rules of the challenge

As an opportunity of learning, practicing, and having fun, I challenge you to get as many stars as you can in
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and share your code here.

By **end of January 2023**, the one with the most stars wins. If there were multiple people with same amount of stars,
the first one wins.

Follow the rules below to share your code, or you'll lose the opportunity to win.

If anything is not covered by the rules here, or there is any ambulation in the rules, the judge (me ðŸ™‚) decides what
to do.

## Rules to share your code

Keywords MUST, RECOMMENDED, MAY in this section follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

You MUST create a folder for your code named with your ID under the folder `2022`, for example, `2022/warmsea`. Any ID
is OK as long as you can prove it's yours.

For the main file to solve a problem, you are RECOMMENDED to include the number of the problem in the file name, for
example, `01.py`. For the input of a problem, you are RECOMMENDED to name it like `01.input`. You MAY have other files
to support your solutions, like `util.py`.

You can use different programming languages for different problems.

Below submitting your code, your answers MUST be YES to ALL the questions below:
* Can your code get the right answers?
* Is the execution time of your code reasonable (<30 seconds)?
* Is your code with consistent code style and reasonable readability?

And, your answers MUST be YES to at least ONE of the questions below:
* Did you optimize the efficiency of your code as much as you can?
  * If you did so only for time, or only for space, you can still answer YES.
* Do you think your code is clean?
* Did you enjoy coding, or did you enjoy it when your code gets the right answers?

## Examples

Files under `2022/warmsea` are submitted by the judge (me ðŸ™‚), you can consider them examples. But they are not
optimized that much, you can do better.
